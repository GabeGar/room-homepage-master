## My process

### Built with

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [framer](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - React framework
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

-   Reinforced my knowledge of CSS Grid but applied it via Tailwind css.
-   Had to conditionally render the hero of the page, one with a wrapper and the other without, in order to get the button to play nice. Atleast, that's the approach I'd taken.
